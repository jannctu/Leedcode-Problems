# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string `s`, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return *the sorted string.*

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```
 
**Constraints:**

* 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup>
* `s` consists of English letters and digits.

## My solution 
```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        x = collections.Counter(s)
        return ''.join(sorted(s, key=lambda l: (x[l],l), reverse=True))
```
